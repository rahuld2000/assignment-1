# Assignment: Create a car search website in Reactjs for desktop-only screens

Objective:
Cars can be searched and paginated through. You can ignore
the Relevance and All Brands filter.
- Car cards are listed 3 on each row and a time 6 cards should
be shown
- Each car card should be designed as it is seen in the image
(not pixel-perfect but should look similar)
- The search should work on the car name.
- On the pagination, the URL should change to page/:page for
example. page/1 -> default, page/2, etc.
- Show only 10 pages for the pagination, it should be hard
coded 10, and should not depend on the car count.
- Pagination should have the next and previous buttons along
with the numbers and it should be fully functional
